# **Boards** #

**First of all, for every project it is desirable to create a board.**

**A new Trello board is empty, ready to organize any of your projects:**

**A board represents a project or a place to keep track of information. No matter if you are launching a new _website_ or a new _application_ or any other thing, a Trello board is the place to organize your tasks as cards on lists and collaborate with your team.**

**You will create separate boards for development, bugs, improvements or any other things which you may find necessary for your project.**

## **Lists** ##

**In every board section board lists have to be created, in our case organized this way: _backlog_, _next_, _in progress_, _staged_, _approved_ and _live_.**

**Lists keep cards organized in their various stages of progress. They can be used to create a workflow where cards are moved across lists from start to finish, or simply act as a place to keep track of ideas and information. Of course, there’s no limit to the number of lists you can add to a board.**

### **Cards** ###

**The basic unit of a board is a card. Cards are used to represent tasks and ideas. A card can be something that needs to be done, whtether you are working on an development, improvement or a bug. Drag and drop cards across lists to show progress. There’s no limit to the number of cards you can add to a board.**
**Cards have different levels of severity, the highest priority have those with highest level of severity, meaning that those most important ones come first when working on a project.**

#### **Card labels** ####

**We like to label our cards in this way:**

- **_bugs_ - red label**
- **_approved_ - green label**
- **_warning_ - orange lebel**
- **_new feature_ - blue label**
- **_improvement_ - yellow label**

**However, these lebels can be different depending on the board you create.**
